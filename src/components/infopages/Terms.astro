                        <p>
                                These Terms &amp; Conditions outline the agreement between Mosi &amp; Lake Safaris ("we", "us") and you, the traveller or
                                travelling party ("you"). By confirming an itinerary or submitting a deposit you acknowledge and accept the terms below.
                        </p>

                        <h3 id="our-service">Our service</h3>
                        <p>
                                We design two bespoke self-drive routes: the Zambia Wild Heart itinerary and the Malawi Lake &amp; Highlands itinerary. Each journey
                                includes a curated sequence of accommodations, vehicle arrangements, activity suggestions, and on-call support. We act as your
                                planner and local liaison; individual services (lodging, vehicle rental, guides) are delivered by third-party partners.
                        </p>

                        <h3 id="booking-and-payments">Booking &amp; payments</h3>
                        <p>
                                A 30% non-refundable deposit confirms your dates. The balance is due 60 days before arrival unless otherwise noted on your proposal.
                                Late payments may result in the release of reserved services. Bank transfer fees or card surcharges are your responsibility.
                        </p>

                        <h3 id="cancellations">Cancellations &amp; changes</h3>
                        <p>
                                Because we partner with small, owner-run camps, cancellations impact our hosts significantly. If you cancel more than 60 days before
                                departure we retain the deposit; within 60 days all payments are non-refundable. We will always advocate on your behalf with suppliers
                                to recover any possible value. Date changes are subject to availability and may incur additional costs.
                        </p>

                        <h3 id="traveller-responsibilities">Traveller responsibilities</h3>
                        <p>
                                You are responsible for holding valid passports, visas, driving permits, and vaccinations. We provide guidance and checklists but the
                                final compliance rests with you. Self-drive travel demands careful attention; you agree to follow local laws, respect wildlife, and drive
                                responsibly on all road surfaces.
                        </p>

                        <h3 id="insurance">Insurance</h3>
                        <p>
                                Comprehensive travel insurance covering medical evacuation, trip cancellation, and vehicle excess is mandatory. Proof of coverage may be
                                requested before final documents are released.
                        </p>

                        <h3 id="liability">Liability</h3>
                        <p>
                                We take great care in selecting trusted partners, yet we cannot control every aspect of their operations. Mosi &amp; Lake Safaris is not
                                liable for injury, loss, or damage arising from acts or omissions of third parties, natural events, or circumstances beyond our reasonable
                                control. Our liability is limited to the total amount paid for the itinerary.
                        </p>

                        <h3 id="privacy">Privacy</h3>
                        <p>
                                We collect only the personal information needed to tailor your safari and operate it safely. Please review our Privacy Policy for detailed
                                information on how we store and protect your data.
                        </p>
