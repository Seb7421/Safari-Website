Raised between Lusaka and Mfuwe, Lina has spent more than a decade guiding guests through Zambia's national parks. She co-founded Mosi & Lake Safaris to share slow, independent travel with people who crave the bush but prefer to set their own rhythm.

Lina personally drives each section of the Wild Heart Route twice a year, updating waypoints, meeting with camp hosts, and checking that the road book reflects current conditions. When she isn't on the trail she mentors young female guides and volunteers with community conservation projects in the Lower Zambezi.

Areas of focus:
- Route scouting and logistics
- Wildlife tracking and guiding
- Cultural immersion planning
- Conservation partnerships
