Packing for a dual-country safari can feel daunting, yet with the right essentials your journey becomes effortless. Here's what we pack for guests before they even think to ask.

## Road trip staples

A lightweight down jacket for crisp mornings, breathable shirts for midday heat, and a kikoi cloth that doubles as shade, blanket, or impromptu picnic cloth. We also include a stainless steel water bottle that fits snugly into the vehicle's cup holders.

## Navigation and communication

Every guest receives our laminated route notes, Garmin GPS with pre-loaded tracks, and a local SIM ready to slot into your unlocked phone. For remote segments we provide a satellite communicator so you can check in even when far from cell towers.

## Comfort and connection

Don't forget a journal for jotting sightings, biodegradable toiletries, and a headlamp with a red-light function to keep the night skies dark. We tuck in small gifts for host communities—locally sourced school supplies and seed packets—so you can say thank you with heart.

Pack light, trust our road book, and you'll have space for the souvenirs and memories waiting in Zambia and Malawi.
