Sofia grew up between Blantyre and the lakeshore village of Chembe. After years of leading cultural immersion programs, she joined Mosi & Lake Safaris to document the human side of our Malawi itineraries.

Her journal entries highlight local artisans, slow food experiences, and the conservation work keeping Lake Malawi's freshwater world thriving. Sofia is the voice behind our Field Notes dispatches and the friendly face welcoming travellers at the start of every Lake & Highlands Route.

Areas of focus:
- Community partnerships
- Storytelling and photography
- Responsible tourism practices
- Lakeshore culture and cuisine
