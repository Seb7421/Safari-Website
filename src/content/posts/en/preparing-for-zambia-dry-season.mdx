When the first mists lift off the Zambezi in May we know dry season has arrived. It is the moment we re-walk every kilometre of the Wild Heart Route to ensure self-drive travellers find the bush at its brilliant best.

## Re-mapping the Lower Zambezi

The river drops quickly, revealing sandbanks that weren't there in March. We update our GPS tracks and add safe detours past the elephant herds that favour the new islands. Expect warm days, cool nights, and extraordinary clarity for photography.

## Tweaking Kafue's pacing

Busanga Plains is all about timing. Balloon safaris launch from mid-June, so we adjust the itinerary to give you two dawns in the air followed by a slow afternoon drive to Mukambi's fig forests. The road surface firms up, making the long stretches smoother for independent drivers.

## Preparing vehicles and guests

Our fleet partners service each 4x4 after the rains: new tyres, fresh recovery gear, and a stocked fridge awaiting your arrival. In your pre-trip call we review expected temperatures, the best layers to pack, and the wildlife hot spots we are tracking that week.

The result? You step into a landscape we know intimately, ready for sightings that only dry season Zambia can reveal.
