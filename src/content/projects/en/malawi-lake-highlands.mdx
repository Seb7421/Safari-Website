### Overview

Our Lake & Highlands Route celebrates Malawi's gentle rhythm. Begin among the tea estates of Thyolo with sundowners on colonial verandas, climb to Nyika Plateau for blue duiker sightings, then glide south to secluded coves on Lake Malawi where wooden dhow sails catch the last light.

### Highlights we cherish

- **Satemwa tea tasting** hosted by the estate manager with a picnic overlooking the rolling fields.
- **Nyika Plateau horse riding** through grasslands, followed by fireside stories from our long-time ranger friends.
- **Lake Malawi snorkelling** off a private island with a conservation briefing on the lake's cichlids.

### What is included

We arrange boutique lodges with warm owner-hosted hospitality, secure the vehicle and all necessary insurances, supply a pre-loaded GPS, and craft a slow-travel-friendly schedule with optional village and art workshops en route.

### Perfect for

Travellers seeking a restorative pace, birders chasing lifers, and families eager for gentle adventure along Africa's most welcoming lake.
