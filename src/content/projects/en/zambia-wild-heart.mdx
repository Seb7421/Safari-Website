### Overview

Our Wild Heart Route is the itinerary that launched Mosi & Lake Safaris. It begins in Lusaka with a private handover of your fully equipped 4x4 before dropping you into Lower Zambezi National Park for canoe sundowners and boat drifts. From there you wind north to Kafue's Busanga Plains, ending with leopard-filled night drives in South Luangwa.

### Highlights we personally vet

- **Lower Zambezi canoe drift** led by guides we trained with, complete with a floating picnic.
- **Kafue wilderness detour** through Mukambi's secret fig forests and the Busanga Plains balloon safari.
- **South Luangwa walking safari** with veteran scout Patrick, capped by a bush dinner beneath cathedral mopanes.

### What is included

Every booking includes the vehicle, lodges on a dinner-and-breakfast basis, detailed road book, and our on-call WhatsApp support. We also secure park fees, conservation levies, and community contributions ahead of your arrival so you can focus on the wildlife unfolding around you.

### Perfect for

Adventurous couples or families who want to feel the pulse of Zambia while knowing a dedicated team is a message away.
